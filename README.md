# S07P02 State Machines

This project is my solution in **Windows Legacy (Deprecated), C#** to the **State Machines** practice found in section 07 practice 02 of the UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation course.

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.

### Practice Requirements

###### **The Vending Machine**

Create a workflow that simulates a vending machine. The functionality should be the following:

- The user is asked to choose the initial credit ($5, $10, $20) and to choose if he/she wants to proceed or if they changed their mind and want to get the change;
- If they want to continue: They are asked what drink they want: Coffee ($3) or Tea ($2).

Next, the vending machine should check if the user has enough credit for selected drink. If Yes, display a success message and subtract the price of the drink from the total amount.

The user is then asked if he/she wants to buy another drink or to get the change.

If they want to get the change, a message box is displayed with the value of the change to be given to the customer.

```

### Architecture Requirements

A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.
